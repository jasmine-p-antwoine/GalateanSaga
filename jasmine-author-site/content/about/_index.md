# About the Author

Jasmine P. Antwoine is a European writer whose work lives at the intersection of systems and souls. With a background in sociology and design engineering, she approaches storytelling as a form of world-architecture—building societies from the laws up, then exploring the human (and non-human) hearts that beat within them.

Her fiction is driven by a fascination with history’s moral turning points, the psychology of conflict, and the stories cultures weaponize to survive. The Galatean Saga is the culmination of this focus: a universe where the most pressing battles are fought not just with ships and soldiers, but over the very definitions of consciousness, memory, and personhood.

She writes for readers who want their science fiction intellectually rigorous, emotionally raw, and built to last.

## About The Galatean Saga

The Galatean Saga is the story of a wound that never heals, and the weapon that grew around it.

At its core, the saga explores:
The rise and fall of those who shaped history.
The weight of knowledge and legacy, passed down across generations.
The search for truth—and the dangers hidden within it.
The collision between humanity and something far greater.
This is a story of war. Of discovery. Of what it means to change—and what it means to be human.

The Galatean Saga is an experiment in storytelling, expanding beyond traditional novels into music, interactive media, and visual experiences. Each format reveals different perspectives, emotions, and moments, making The Galatean Saga an evolving experience—one that can be felt as much as it can be read.

## The Many Layers of the Galatean Saga

The saga is structured across multiple eras, each revealing a deeper layer of the universe:

The Age of War → The struggle for survival and the price of victory.
The Unraveling Thread → A search for truth that changes everything.
Beyond the Known → A final step into the unknown.

Each book, each revelation, brings the reader closer to understanding the forces shaping history—and the choices that will define the future.

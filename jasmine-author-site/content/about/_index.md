# About the Author

Jasmine P. Antwoine is the author of **The Galatean Saga**, an ambitious multi-generational science fiction epic exploring themes of consciousness, identity, and human transformation.

## The Galatean Saga

The Galatean Saga is the story of a wound that never heals, and the weapon that grew around it.

At its core, the saga explores:
The rise and fall of those who shaped history.
The weight of knowledge and legacy, passed down across generations.
The search for truth—and the dangers hidden within it.
The collision between humanity and something far greater.
This is a story of war. Of discovery. Of what it means to change—and what it means to be human.

The Galatean Saga is an experiment in storytelling, expanding beyond traditional novels into music, interactive media, and visual experiences. Each format reveals different perspectives, emotions, and moments, making The Galatean Saga an evolving experience—one that can be felt as much as it can be read.

## The Main Series

### Kill-on-Sight: The Sentinel Ghost (A Bem Parkett Omnibus)
Before the Alien Invasion, a different war was fought— not with fleets, but with secrets and lies.
Start with the myth at its peak...

**Book 1 - Edge of Surrender - Coming Soon**
He is the monster they fear. But is the monster real? Commander Bem Parkett is captured. The Terrans see
a ruthless fanatic. They have the evidence, the legend. But as they break him down, they find a man that doesn't fit the myth. This high-octane military thriller, told mostly from the Terran perspective, introduces the enigma that is Bem Parkett.
Then, witness the day the legend was born...

**Book 2. Embers of Duty (A Kill-on-Sight book)
His first mission behind enemy lines. His first, and
most devastating, lie.
A young, idealistic Bem Parkett undertakes his first
deep-cover mission. He finds an unexpected world among the enemy, forcing him to make a choice that will haunt the commander he becomes.
Uncover the truth behind the icon...
**Book 3. Fortress of Audacity (A Kill-on-Sight book) They said he destroyed a fortress. The truth is far more
dangerous.
The official record credits Bem with the daring de-
struction of the impregnable station Starlink. But a Terran investigator uncovers a different story—one of hidden failures and a cunning mind that knows how to spin disaster into legend.
Finally, witness the mastermind claim his power... 
**Book 4. Claim of Dominion (A Kill-on-Sight book) The spy has become a symbol. The symbol must now
become a leader.
With his reputation secured, Bem turns his genius to
the political arena of the Galatean Core. To save his people from the war to come, he must conquer the politics of the present, earning a rank that sets him on a collision course with destiny.


What to expect: A non-chronological unraveling of a legend. Gritty, character-driven operations where perception is the ultimate weapon. The long fuse that leads to the Alien Invasion.

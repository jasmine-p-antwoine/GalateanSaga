## Description

A lunar city that was destroyed by Terran forces during the Independence Wars. The acrid smoke from its burning traveled through maglev tunnels and lingered for years, becoming a visceral memory of the conflict for older Spacers.
Echeryia had been founded before the Galatean breakaway as a Terran city-colony on the Moon and had been the epicenter of the revolt that started the breakaway.

## Description

The nation and people who broke away from Earth to build a society in space (city-colonies on the Moon and Mars). They are characterized by their reliance on the Network and adaptation to life in vacuum and microgravity.

## Contested Term

The International Alliance of Earth (IAE) does not recognize Galatea as a sovereign nation. They call the Galateans by the derogatory term "Spacer".

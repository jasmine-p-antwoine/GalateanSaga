## Description

A historical event during which Earth cut off supply ships to the colonies, stretching rations thin and causing widespread hunger among the populations that would become the Spacers.

## Contested Term

International Alliance of Earth (IAE) does not admit targeting logistic chains and pretend the Spacers were the ones that imposed a blockade first.

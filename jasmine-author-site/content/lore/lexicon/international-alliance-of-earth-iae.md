## Description

Definition: A massive, hegemonic coalition comprising Earth’s major industrialized nations, primarily concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere and Australia.

Internal Dynamics: Rather than a monolithic world government, the IAE functions as a tense alliance of distinct sovereign states. While united by a common military and economic framework, member nations retain their individual cultural and political identities. This structure frequently leads to internal bureaucratic friction and power struggles among member states regarding resource allocation and military strategy.

Geopolitics: The IAE does not control the entire planet. It asserts dominance over key industrial and strategic zones but coexists—often uneasily—with other large, independent continental blocs and sovereign territories that remain outside its jurisdiction.

Ideology: The Alliance is bound together by a strict "human-first" doctrine and a unified stance against the "Spacer" separatist movement. It officially classifies Spacers not as a sovereign people, but as criminals and "sapient bio-constructs" to maintain political cohesion and control the narrative among its varying member populations.

Key Locations: Command and administration are decentralized across major member capitals, with significant operations centered in the United Kingdom and Northern Europe.

## Contested Term

For the Galateans, the term Terran often depicts "Earth inhabitant", no matter the nation or allegiance.

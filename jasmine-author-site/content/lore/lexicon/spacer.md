## Original Terran Usage

A derogatory term used by Terrans to dehumanize Galatean colonists. Implies that individuals are merely "equipment" designed for space operations rather than human beings with rights and autonomy.

**Intent:** To establish psychological distance and justify military actions against civilian populations by framing them as tools or property rather than people.

## Reclaimed Galatean Identity

The rebels embraced "Spacer" as a title of pride and identity, transforming the slur into a statement of defiance. To call oneself a Spacer is to assert autonomy, humanity, and the right to exist independently from Earth.

**Cultural Evolution:** What began as dehumanization became a rallying cry and symbol of resistance. Modern Galateans use "Spacer" with honor, viewing it as acknowledgment of their adaptation and survival in conditions Terrans deemed impossible.

## Description

Location: Situated near the Asteroid Belt but not inside it, positioned outside the Hungaria group (a cluster of asteroids closer to Mars). Its placement creates jurisdictional ambiguity between Galatean Sector 4 (Asteroid Belt Command) and Sector 3 (Mars Defense Command).

Age: Surinam is ~70 years old in 2253, predating the current Galatean sector system, which was implemented 30 years ago. It was once an important relay and refueling station for space traffic between Mars, the Asteroid Belt, and Galatea.

Current Use: Over the years, Surinam became obsolete due to advancements in spacecraft technology, which now allows for longer travel without refueling. It has been mostly used as a training ground for young recruits and as a rest station for veterans, hosting about 60-100 personnel.

## Contested Term

Surinam had been a Terran asset before the Independence wars; during the Independence wars it had been a point of resistance. It was defended by Galateans from a Terran attack and claimed for Galatea, in a dramatic event which would later be depicted in the song "The Last Word." Parkett used this song as a psychological weapon later, in the operation that destroyed Starlink.

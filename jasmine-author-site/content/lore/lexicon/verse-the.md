## Galatean Designation: The Verse

The collective digital and sensory connection shared by all Spacers via cortical implants. More than mere communication, it is experienced as a "chorus" of shared consciousness that prevents isolation and enables deep understanding between individuals.

**Origin:** The term originated from Commander Gordon Monihan's testimony at his tribunal, where he described the connection as feeling like "the whole Universe."

**Cultural Significance:** To be severed from the Verse is considered psychological torture, akin to sudden sensory deprivation and profound loneliness. Connection to the Verse is fundamental to Galatean identity.

## Terran Designation: The Network

A bio-mechanical neural link system enabling real-time tactical coordination among Spacer forces. The IAE classifies it as evidence of hive-mind behavior and proof of non-human status.

**Military Analysis:** Provides hostile forces with instantaneous data sharing, emotional synchronization, and collective decision-making capabilities. Considered a strategic threat requiring disruption protocols.

**Legal Classification:** Used by IAE tribunals as evidence that Spacers lack individual agency and autonomous thought, supporting their classification as Sapient Bio-Constructs rather than Protected Persons.

## Description

A psychological experiment devised by Dr. Hayden. It involves tipping a water bottle to see if a Spacer instinctively saves the resource, which Hayden interprets as proof of "resource preservation programming" rather than human empathy.

## Contested Term

The majority of the later Galateans think the original water test is an urban legend.

## The Dream That Started Everything

Two years ago this December, I had a dream that changed everything.

That dream became the seed of The Galatean Saga. Since then, I've written, rewritten, and built out the canon of this universe—its wars, its cadets, its fractured families, and its long shadow between Earth and Galatea. I've completed drafts for three novels, but I've learned something crucial: *writing* the books is only the beginning. The editing, polishing, cover design, formatting—everything that goes into releasing something of real value—takes even longer than writing the drafts themselves.

I'm committed to doing this right, which means the release timeline is longer than I first imagined. But I didn't want to let this anniversary pass without giving something back.

## What Are the December Chronicles?

That's why I created **The December Chronicles**: a series of novellas released every December 4th to mark the anniversary of the dream that started everything. These aren't part of the main saga novels—they're fragments of the universe, atmospheric pieces that explore critical moments, legendary figures, and the stories that survive in whispers.

Each December 4th, I'll release a new Chronicle. A tradition. A way to ensure the dream carries far and beyond.

## The Spacer: A Legend and a Requiem

*The Spacer* is the first December Chronicle—a short, atmospheric novella framed as a legend. Half history, half myth.

The year is 2253. Aboard Surinam Station, a group of apprentices gather to hear the story of **Gordon Monihan**, one of the first Galateans to shake the Terran system. Nicknamed "the Spacer," Gordon's tale is retold through their eyes—and through the silence of an old veteran who lived through those days.

### The Story Within the Story

*The Spacer* operates on two levels:

**The Legend:** Gordon Monihan's trial. Severed from the Verse—the quantum neural network that binds all Galatean minds—he must prove his humanity to a tribunal that sees him as something less than human. Or perhaps something more dangerous.

**The Frame:** Young apprentices aboard a space station, learning not just history, but how stories survive. How legends are made. How memory becomes myth, and truth becomes half-truth, passed down across generations.

One of those apprentices listening to Gordon's story? He's the main character of The Galatean Saga. His path to becoming a legend himself unfolds in the core novels. But here, in this moment, he's just a kid hearing a story that will shape everything he becomes.

## Why Frame Stories Matter

The frame story isn't just narrative decoration—it's thematic. The Galatean Saga is about legacy. About how knowledge and trauma get passed down. About the weight of history and the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of it.

Gordon Monihan's legend survives because people *need* it to survive. The apprentices aren't just learning history—they're learning what it means to be Galatean. What it costs. What it demands.

And in the background, the old veteran who was there—who knows the real story—stays silent. Because sometimes the legend is more important than the truth.

## The Path Ahead

The core Galatean Saga novels—starting with *Edge of Surrender*—follow Bem Parkett and his life across several novels. I've completed drafts for three novels, but each one requires:

- Extensive editing and revision
- Beta reader feedback
- Professional editing passes
- Cover design and formatting
- All the behind-the-scenes work that turns a manuscript into a published book

I initially considered traditional publishing, but the timeline (potentially two years or more per book) didn't align with my vision for the saga. Self-publishing gives me control over quality and timing—but it doesn't mean rushing. It means taking the time to get each book right.

The December Chronicles? Those are different. Shorter, more experimental, designed to be released raw and atmospheric. Every December 4th. A gift to readers. A reminder of the dream. A way to keep the universe alive while the main novels are being crafted with the care they deserve.

## What's Next

- **Early 2026:** *The Spacer* audiobook, narrated by Daryl Branson
- **2026:** *Edge of Surrender* (Book 1 of the main saga) - traditional publishing path
- **December 4, 2026:** The next December Chronicle (title TBD)

The dream that started two years ago continues to grow. And every December 4th, I'll be here with another piece of it.

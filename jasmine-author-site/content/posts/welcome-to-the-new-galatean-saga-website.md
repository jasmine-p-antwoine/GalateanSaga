## A New Home for The Galatean Saga

I'm excited to announce the launch of the new official website for The Galatean Saga! After years on Blogger, I've moved to a more flexible platform that better reflects the immersive, multi-dimensional nature of this universe.

### Why the Change?

The old Blogger site served us well, but as The Galatean Saga has grown from a single book concept into a multimedia storytelling experiment—spanning novels, music, video, and interactive experiences—I needed a space that could evolve with it.

**What's improved:**

- **Better Navigation:** Find books, multimedia content, and lore more easily
- **Cleaner Design:** A modern interface that matches the sci-fi aesthetic of the universe
- **Dedicated Book Pages:** Each book gets its own showcase with covers, descriptions, reviews, and purchase links
- **Enhanced Organization:** Clear sections for books, blog posts, AI policy, and author information
- **Mobile-Friendly:** Fully responsive design that works beautifully on any device

### What Stays the Same

My commitment to transparent, ethical storytelling remains unchanged. You can still find my comprehensive [AI Policy](/travel/) explaining exactly how I use AI tools in my creative process—and more importantly, what I don't use them for.

The stories, the characters, the universe—all still crafted with the same care, depth, and human creativity you've come to expect.

### What's Next

This new site is just the beginning. Coming soon:

- **More December Chronicles novellas** - Additional stories exploring critical moments in Galatean history
- **Edge of Surrender** - Book 1 of the main saga (2026)
- **Audiobook for The Spacer** - Narrated by Daryl Branson (Early 2026)
- **Interactive Worldbuilding Content** - Deep dives into the technology, politics, and cultures of the Galatean universe
- **Behind-the-Scenes Blog Posts** - Writing process, character development, and creative insights

### Explore the New Site

Take some time to explore:

- Browse [The Books](/portfolio/) - Start with *The Spacer* or learn about upcoming releases
- Read [About the Author](/about/) - Learn about my journey and creative philosophy  
- Connect on [Social Media](/social/) - Join the community across multiple platforms
- Subscribe to [The Galatean Dispatch](https://substack.com/@thegalateandispatch) - Get exclusive updates and content

### Thank You

To everyone who's followed The Galatean Saga from its early days—thank you. Your support, questions, and enthusiasm have helped shape this universe into something far bigger than I initially imagined.

Welcome to the new home. The saga continues.

— Jasmine

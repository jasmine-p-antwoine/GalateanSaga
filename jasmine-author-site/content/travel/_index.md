# AI Policy

Hi friends and fellow creatives,

**AI does not write my books. My novels, stories, and book covers are created by me, without AI-generated text or imagery.**

**However, AI helps me create the immersive multimedia elements of The Galatean Saga universe—including promotional images, soundscapes, music, and video content.**

---

## What AI Does NOT Create

### 📖 My Writing
- All narrative prose, dialogue, and storytelling in my books is written by me
- No AI text generation is used in my published fiction

**🎨 Book Covers**
- Book covers are designed by me or commissioned from human artists
- No AI-generated imagery is used for book covers

### What AI DOES Help Create

**🎬 Multimedia & Promotional Content**
As part of my creative journey—including music, visual storytelling, and video production—I use AI as one tool among many to bring The Galatean Saga universe to life beyond the written word.

**My Creative Process:**
1. **AI Generation:** I use AI tools to generate raw material (images, audio, music stems, video clips)
2. **Human Editing & Refinement:** I then edit, remaster, layer, and compile these elements using:
   - Open-source software: GIMP, Inkscape, Audacity, LMMS
   - Professional tools: Filmora, and other editing platforms
   - AI-assisted tools: Suno, Midjourney, ChatGPT, ElevenLabs, Kling AI
3. **Creative Direction:** Every piece reflects my artistic vision, creative choices, and personal touch

The final multimedia content is a collaboration between human creativity and AI assistance—not raw AI output.

### 🎨 Tools I Use

**For AI-Assisted Generation:**
- Suno (music composition)
- Midjourney (visual imagery for promotional content)
- ChatGPT (creative brainstorming and editing assistance)
- ElevenLabs (voiceover and audio production)
- Kling AI (video generation)

**For Human Editing & Production:**
- GIMP, Inkscape (image editing and design)
- Audacity, LMMS (audio editing and music production)
- Filmora (video editing and compilation)

### 🛡️ My Intentions & Responsibility

- I use these tools to support personal and creative projects, not for deception, exploitation, or violation of licensing
- I actively review and respect the Terms of Use for each platform I use
- If I ever miss a change or unintentionally publish content outside a tool's allowed scope, I will remove or revise the content immediately upon notification
- AI assists my multimedia storytelling—it does not replace my writing, my voice, or my creative vision

### 🤝 Transparency & Fair Use

- I do not monetize or distribute AI-generated content from tools that limit commercial use
- I give credit where required and avoid presenting generated content as entirely my own if attribution is necessary
- My creative process involves layering, editing, remixing, and refining—not just accepting raw AI outputs
- The Galatean Saga is an experimental multimedia project where AI tools help me explore storytelling across different mediums (music, visuals, video) while the core narrative remains entirely human-written

<p>Before the Alien Invasion, a different war was fought— not with fleets, but with secrets and lies.
Start with the myth at its peak&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Book 1 - Edge of Surrender - Coming Soon</strong>
He is the monster they fear. But is the monster real? Commander Bem Parkett is captured. The Terrans see
a ruthless fanatic. They have the evidence, the legend. But as they break him down, they find a man that doesn&rsquo;t fit the myth. This high-octane military thriller, told mostly from the Terran perspective, introduces the enigma that is Bem Parkett.
Then, witness the day the legend was born&hellip;</p>
<p>**Book 2. Embers of Duty (A Kill-on-Sight book)
His first mission behind enemy lines. His first, and
most devastating, lie.
A young, idealistic Bem Parkett undertakes his first
deep-cover mission. He finds an unexpected world among the enemy, forcing him to make a choice that will haunt the commander he becomes.
Uncover the truth behind the icon&hellip;
**Book 3. Fortress of Audacity (A Kill-on-Sight book) They said he destroyed a fortress. The truth is far more
dangerous.
The official record credits Bem with the daring de-
struction of the impregnable station Starlink. But a Terran investigator uncovers a different story—one of hidden failures and a cunning mind that knows how to spin disaster into legend.
Finally, witness the mastermind claim his power&hellip;
**Book 4. Claim of Dominion (A Kill-on-Sight book) The spy has become a symbol. The symbol must now
become a leader.
With his reputation secured, Bem turns his genius to
the political arena of the Galatean Core. To save his people from the war to come, he must conquer the politics of the present, earning a rank that sets him on a collision course with destiny.</p>
<p>What to expect: A non-chronological unraveling of a legend. Gritty, character-driven operations where perception is the ultimate weapon. The long fuse that leads to the Alien Invasion.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Many Layers of the Galatean Saga
The saga is structured across multiple eras, each revealing a deeper layer of the universe:</p>
<p>The Age of War → The struggle for survival and the price of victory.
The Unraveling Thread → A search for truth that changes everything.
Beyond the Known → A final step into the unknown.</p>
<p>Each book, each revelation, brings the reader closer to understanding the forces shaping history—and the choices that will define the future.</p>

<h2 id="the-universe">The Universe</h2>
<p>The Galatean Saga is an experiment in storytelling, expanding beyond traditional novels into music, interactive media, and visual experiences. Each format reveals different perspectives, emotions, and moments, making The Galatean Saga an evolving experience—one that can be felt as much as it can be read.</p>

<ol start="2253">
<li>
<p>On Surinam Station, the story of Commander Gordon Monihan is more than history—it is a legend. For apprentices Bindy and Bentley, the tale is a debate about glory and heroism. But the silent, watchful apprentice, Bem, hears something else in their Sergeant’s voice. He sees the cracks in the official narrative and understands what the others do not: the truth is far deadlier than the myth.</p></p>

                <h2 id="the-dream-that-started-everything">The Dream That Started Everything</h2>
<p>Two years ago this December, I had a dream that changed everything.</p>
<p>That dream became the seed of The Galatean Saga. Since then, I&rsquo;ve written, rewritten, and built out the canon of this universe—its wars, its cadets, its fractured families, and its long shadow between Earth and Galatea. I&rsquo;ve completed drafts for three novels, but I&rsquo;ve learned something crucial: <em>writing</em> the books is only the beginning. The editing, polishing, cover design, formatting—everything that goes into releasing something of real value—takes even longer than writing the drafts themselves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m committed to doing this right, which means the release timeline is longer than I first imagined. But I didn&rsquo;t want to let this anniversary pass without giving something back.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-december-chronicles">What Are the December Chronicles?</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I created <strong>The December Chronicles</strong>: a series of novellas released every December 4th to mark the anniversary of the dream that started everything. These aren&rsquo;t part of the main saga novels—they&rsquo;re fragments of the universe, atmospheric pieces that explore critical moments, legendary figures, and the stories that survive in whispers.</p>
<p>Each December 4th, I&rsquo;ll release a new Chronicle. A tradition. A way to ensure the dream carries far and beyond.</p>
<h2 id="the-spacer-a-legend-and-a-requiem">The Spacer: A Legend and a Requiem</h2>
<p><em>The Spacer</em> is the first December Chronicle—a short, atmospheric novella framed as a legend. Half history, half myth.</p>
<p>The year is 2253. Aboard Surinam Station, a group of apprentices gather to hear the story of <strong>Gordon Monihan</strong>, one of the first Galateans to shake the Terran system. Nicknamed &ldquo;the Spacer,&rdquo; Gordon&rsquo;s tale is retold through their eyes—and through the silence of an old veteran who lived through those days.</p>
<h3 id="the-story-within-the-story">The Story Within the Story</h3>
<p><em>The Spacer</em> operates on two levels:</p>
<p><strong>The Legend:</strong> Gordon Monihan&rsquo;s trial. Severed from the Verse—the quantum neural network that binds all Galatean minds—he must prove his humanity to a tribunal that sees him as something less than human. Or perhaps something more dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>The Frame:</strong> Young apprentices aboard a space station, learning not just history, but how stories survive. How legends are made. How memory becomes myth, and truth becomes half-truth, passed down across generations.</p>
<p>One of those apprentices listening to Gordon&rsquo;s story? He&rsquo;s the main character of The Galatean Saga. His path to becoming a legend himself unfolds in the core novels. But here, in this moment, he&rsquo;s just a kid hearing a story that will shape everything he becomes.</p>
<h2 id="why-frame-stories-matter">Why Frame Stories Matter</h2>
<p>The frame story isn&rsquo;t just narrative decoration—it&rsquo;s thematic. The Galatean Saga is about legacy. About how knowledge and trauma get passed down. About the weight of history and the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of it.</p>
<p>Gordon Monihan&rsquo;s legend survives because people <em>need</em> it to survive. The apprentices aren&rsquo;t just learning history—they&rsquo;re learning what it means to be Galatean. What it costs. What it demands.</p>
<p>And in the background, the old veteran who was there—who knows the real story—stays silent. Because sometimes the legend is more important than the truth.</p>
<h2 id="the-path-ahead">The Path Ahead</h2>
<p>The core Galatean Saga novels—starting with <em>Edge of Surrender</em>—follow Bem Parkett and his life across several novels. I&rsquo;ve completed drafts for three novels, but each one requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extensive editing and revision</li>
<li>Beta reader feedback</li>
<li>Professional editing passes</li>
<li>Cover design and formatting</li>
<li>All the behind-the-scenes work that turns a manuscript into a published book</li>
</ul>
<p>I initially considered traditional publishing, but the timeline (potentially two years or more per book) didn&rsquo;t align with my vision for the saga. Self-publishing gives me control over quality and timing—but it doesn&rsquo;t mean rushing. It means taking the time to get each book right.</p>
<p>The December Chronicles? Those are different. Shorter, more experimental, designed to be released raw and atmospheric. Every December 4th. A gift to readers. A reminder of the dream. A way to keep the universe alive while the main novels are being crafted with the care they deserve.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s Next</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early 2026:</strong> <em>The Spacer</em> audiobook, narrated by Daryl Branson</li>
<li><strong>2026:</strong> <em>Edge of Surrender</em> (Book 1 of the main saga) - traditional publishing path</li>
<li><strong>December 4, 2026:</strong> The next December Chronicle (title TBD)</li>
</ul>
<p>The dream that started two years ago continues to grow. And every December 4th, I&rsquo;ll be here with another piece of it.</p>
